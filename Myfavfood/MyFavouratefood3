<h1>My favourite food's ingredients</h1>
  <p>This is a very popular street food in uganda, started in the capital Kampala but has 
      spread to the rest of the country. It is a regular chapati rolled with an egg or 2
    and sliced tomatoes and onions </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wheat flour</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Cooking oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The preparation process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pour the wheat flour, salt, and ghee into a bowl and mix the 
      ingredients together</li>
    <li>Add ½ a cup of water to the flour mixture and stir the mixture until 
      it's soft and supple.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining water slowly, stirring until it's fully combined.</li>
    <li>Place the dough into an oiled bowl and cover it for 25 minutes.✔️</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 10-12 small balls, and dip them into flour.</li>
    <li>Roll the dough with a rolling pin until the balls resemble thin, 
      round pancakes 😁.</li>
    <li>Heat a heavy frying pan, tawa, or griddle over medium heat and cook 
      each chapati on both sides 😍</li>
    <li>Beat 2 eggs with tomatoes and onions mixed together and fry on the same
      pan</li>
    <li>Place the egg onto the chapati and make a roll</li>
    <li>Serve 😋</li>
